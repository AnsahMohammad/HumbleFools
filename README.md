Our team is making a website. This website helps user in making a "Shopping List Budget". The amount range decided in the budget will be the outcome of an algorithm which will fetch the data from various e-commerce website.
With the budget the user can also check out the best online options to purchase the product. Also, if the user is not satisfied with the online options, the website will show the offline options which include the nearby shops to the customer.

With website being a guide for the user to purchase a product, we can combine the benefits of affiliate marketing with links that will be shared on the website.
